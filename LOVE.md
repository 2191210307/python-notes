### I love someone in my memory.  
Somebody met me in a beautiful night.  
She gave me something and ran away.  
She was so shy.  
And I couldn't stop her.  
She is elder and more mature than me.  
She is sensitive and brave.  
I can't figure out her.  
I have a deep interest in her.  
I'm so happy because I can stay with her by some reasonable things.  

But I have a busy life and so does she.
